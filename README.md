# Design System

This is a Monorepo created through the Ignite ReactJS course. Here we have 5 Packages which is managed by turborepo and changeset. The design system uses of the react directory which has the components. The components use the tokens of the application. Another packages are reusable configurations such as `typescript` and `eslint`. The packages are published into the NPM and they are using github actions to automate the build and deploy of the packages (CI / CD).
